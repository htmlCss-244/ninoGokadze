        <img id="Lambo wrd" src="./img/Lambo wrd.jpg" class="center">

        <p>Lamborghini was founded in 1963 by Italian entrepreneur Ferruccio Lamborghini in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy. Initially a successful manufacturer of tractors, Ferruccio decided to create his own luxury sports car brand after becoming dissatisfied with the quality of certain high-end cars he owned. His goal was to build refined, high-performance grand touring cars that could rival Ferrari. The result was Automobili Lamborghini, which quickly gained fame for its innovative engineering and bold design.</p>

        <p>The evolution of Lamborghini cars began in the 1960s with the  <span style="color: red;">350 GT</span> , which set the standard for the brand’s high-performance grand tourers. In the 1970s, models like the <span style="color: red;">Miura</span> and <span style="color: red;">Countach </span> revolutionized the industry with their bold, futuristic designs and advanced engineering. Later, the <span style="color: red;">Diablo</span>, <span style="color: red;">Murciélago</span>, and <span style="color: red;">Gallardo</span> introduced modern technologies, improved aerodynamics, and more powerful engines. In recent years, the <span style="color: red;">Aventador</span> and <span style="color: red;">Huracán</span>  have represented the peak of Lamborghini’s innovation, featuring lightweight materials, hybrid systems, and highly refined design.</p>

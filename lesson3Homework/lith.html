        <h1>Travel to Lithuania</h1>
        <br>

        <p>I decided to spend my autumn holidays in Lithuania. I arrived at Vilnius Airport, <b>"Tarptautinis Vilniaus oro uostas".</b>  I had planned to visit traditional restaurants and taste their cuisine, as well as explore various streets and landmarks.</p>

        <p>On the first day, I was on a beautiful street with lovely decorations, greenery, and lighting. I visited several landmarks.</p>

        <p>On the second day, I tasted traditional food, including schnitzel, which was very delicious. I also tried traditional dishes from other countries. The remaining days were rather monotonous; we walked through the streets and enjoyed the autumn days.</p>
